This is sample code for Brian Mitchell's JdayUSA 2025 presentation.
**We are not Savages: Understanding the What and Why Behind Joomla Extensions** - https://www.jdayusa.com/sessions/whats-behind-joomla-extensions

While the code works these are posted for illustration ONLY. The component in particular has A TON of excess structure and unnecessary code for what it does. It is NOT a good example of functional code, but served the presentation well in terms of providing "scaffolding" for understanding what the different parts of a Joomla component might include.

Refer to Joomla documentation https://docs.joomla.org/ and https://manual.joomla.org/ for much more comprehensive information.
